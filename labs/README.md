# Labs Introduction

These labs will give the full experience of deploying, discover, visualize and creating dashboards using OpenSearch. Every lab contains several exercises to complete.

If you are unable to complete certain exercises, no problem. You can always complete the other labs.

This hands-on lab experience would focus on using OpenSearch and creating searches, visualizations and dashboards in OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Prerequisites

You may use any `OpenSearch` environment, but as minimum we advice the following prerequisites that are part of [Lab 2](02-ClusterDeployment/README.md). For simplicity we are making use of a demo deployment using `Docker compose`. Keep in mind this is for training purposes only!!

- 1 or more (virtual) CPUs available.
- At least 4G of Memory.
- Approx 5 GB available for storage.

** This training is developed and tested using OpenSearch v2.6 release **

## Next Steps

You are ready to start with the first lab about [Introduction](01-Introduction/README.md) in OpenSearch.

Enjoy the exercises!!!
